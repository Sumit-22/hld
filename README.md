# High-Level Design (HLD) in Simple Terms

High-Level Design (HLD) is like creating a blueprint for a software system before actually building it. It gives an overview of how different parts of the system will work together. HLD is created before Low-Level Design (LLD) and actual coding.

## Why is HLD Important?
- **Gives a Clear Picture** – Helps developers, architects, and stakeholders understand how the system will be structured.
- **Saves Time & Effort** – Prevents mistakes by planning the system before writing code.
- **Ensures Scalability & Performance** – Ensures the system can handle growth in users and data.

## Key Components of HLD
